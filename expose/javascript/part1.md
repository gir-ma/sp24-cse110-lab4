3. ```values added: 20```
4. Error: result is not defined. Since we used ```let``` to declare ```result``` in this code it is not accessible  outside of the ```if``` block.
5. ```TypeError: Assignment to constant variable.``` we cannot reassign a value to the variable again because we have declared it using ```const``` above.
6. ```TypeError: Assignment to constant variable.```Since we used ```const``` to declare ```result``` in this code it is not accessible outside of the ```if``` block: it's block-scoped.
